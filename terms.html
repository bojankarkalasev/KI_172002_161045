        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p>
          The following document outlines the terms of use of the Imgly website. Before using any of the Imgly services, you are required to read, understand, and agree to these terms.
        </p>

        <h3>Description of Service</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Imgly DOO Skopje (“Imgly”, “we”, “us” or “our”) provides a platform via its website and apps (the “Site”) to a community of registered users (“users” or “you”) to engage in a variety of activities, including to upload and display photographs (“Visual Content”), share comments, opinions, and ideas, promote Visual Content Galleries, participate in contests and promotions, register for premium membership accounts (“Premium Accounts”), and license Visual Content through our distributors (individually and collectively, the “Services”). The foregoing list of Services is not all-inclusive and additional Services may be offered by us from time to time. The following are the terms of use (“Terms”) for using the Site and the Services.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-2 pb-2">
        <h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND THOSE YOU REPRESENT, TO COMPLY WITH AND BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THESE TERMS AS WELL AS OUR PRIVACY POLICY AND ALL APPLICABLE LAWS. IF YOU, FOR YOURSELF OR ON BEHALF OF THOSE YOU REPRESENT, DO NOT AGREE TO ANY PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, YOU MUST, FOR YOURSELF AND ON BEHALF ANY SUCH PERSON(S), DISCONTINUE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND, IF YOU ARE ALREADY REGISTERED, CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT.        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pt-2 pb-2">
        <h3>Modification of Terms</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Imgly reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace the Terms at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to the Terms, Imgly will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site. What constitutes a material change will be determined at Imgly’s sole discretion. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Using any Service or viewing any Visual Content constitutes your acceptance of the Terms as modified.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          In addition, when using particular features of the Services, you are subject to any posted guidelines, terms or rules applicable to such Services.
        </p><br />
        <p>
          Your access to and use of the Site and our Services may be interrupted from time to time as a result of equipment malfunction, updating, maintenance or repair of the Site or any other reason within or outside of our control. Imgly reserves the right to suspend or discontinue the availability of the Site, any Service, and to remove any Visual Content at any time at its sole discretion and without prior notice. Imgly may also impose limits on certain features and Services or restrict your access to parts of or all of the Site and the Services without notice or liability. The Site should not be used or relied upon for storage of your Visual Content and you are directed to retain your own copies of all Visual Content posted on the Site.

      </div>
      <div class="pt-2 pb-2">
        <h3>Registration</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          As a condition to using the Services, you are required to open an account with Imgly, select a password and username, and to provide registration information including a valid email address, which may be used to transfer royalty payments to you for licensing Visual Content. The registration information you provide must be accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your access to the Services, by terminating your account. Any personal information that you provide to Imgly is governed by the Imgly Privacy Policy.<br />
          You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar, or obscene. <br />
          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and are solely responsible for all activities resulting from the use of your password and conducted through your Imgly account. <br />
          Services are available to authorized representatives of legal entities and to individuals who are either (i) at least 18 years old to register for Premium Accounts or license Visual Content through Imgly, or (ii) at least 14 years old, and who are authorized to access the Site by a parent or legal guardian. If you have authorized a minor to use the Site, you are responsible for the online conduct of such minor, and the consequences of any misuse of the Site by the minor. Parents and legal guardians are warned that the Site does display Visual Content containing nudity and violence that may be offensive to some.<br />
          The Services are for use by a) individuals who own Visual Content; and b) entities that represent owners of Visual Content including, but not limited to, galleries, agents, representatives, distributors, and other market intermediaries. We are currently not accepting video, illustrations, and graphic design content to upload on the Site. If you are the owner of the Visual Content, but not the creator, you are not allowed to upload content for the purposes of self-advertising.<br />
