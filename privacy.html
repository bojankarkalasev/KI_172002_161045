        <p>
          Imgly is founded on the principle of helping people discover new photos and photographers. We know that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. By visiting the Imgly website, registering with Imgly, or using any Imgly services, you are accepting and agree to comply with this policy.

        <h3>Information Collected by Imgly</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <b>We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We collect the following types of information from our Imgly users:</b>

        <h4>Information You Provide To Us</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          1) We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.<br />
          2) Registration: In order for you to use Imgly services you must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require certain personal information. Our lawful basis for collecting personal information from you is to provide our services and to communicate with you with your consent when you register with us. Our collection of personal information from you is limited to information that we require in order to provide our services to you.<br />
          3) User Profile: To allow you to express yourself beyond just the information collected during registration, we enable you to provide additional information, such as your first and last names, email address, social media account links, a bio, and website URL. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. As indicated below, in the section titled "Sharing Your Information", you can control how your information is displayed and used.<br />
          4) You have the right to edit, update, access, or transfer your personal information, or to delete your personal information if you are terminating your registration with Imgly.

        <h3>Automatic Information</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          1) We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Imgly and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser and apps including your IP address, Imgly cookie information, and the page you requested. Imgly uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends, and administer the website. This does not involve collecting any of your personal information.<br />
          2) In addition to the "traffic data", Imgly and its authorized agents may collect information about the device you're using to access Imgly, its operating system, unique device identifier, device settings such as language, and crash data. Which data is specifically collected depends on the type of device and/or system running on that device. This data is again used to help us diagnose problems with the site and/or mobile apps and analyze trends. This does not involve collecting any of your personal information.<br />
          3) Imgly may collect and use information regarding the geographic location of your devices. If the location data contains your personal information, then Imgly will treat this location data in accordance with this Policy.<br />
          4) Imgly may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes User Profile pages.<br />
          5) Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Imgly will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.<br />

        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Imgly cookies do not collect personal information.<br />
          Imgly utilizes third-party services like Google Analytics to help analyze how our site is used. These services, including Google Analytics, also use cookies to collect information about visitors to our site (including IP addresses) in an anonymous form that does not include personal information.<br />
          The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of Imgly's coolest features. Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.<br />

          Imgly uses services like Google Analytics and/or Amplitude to help analyze and understand how our site and mobile applications are used, so that we can make Imgly products more interesting to you. These tools capture data about how individual users are using our site and mobile applications. This includes event logs, device type, and device configuration settings such as language, crash data, and other data but never personal information. These third-party services treat the analytics data in accordance with this privacy policy and Imgly does not disclose your personal information to any third parties through our use of these services.

        <h4>Keeping Information and Our Website Secure</h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Your Imgly account information is protected by an encrypted password for your privacy and security. Protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.<br />
          Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.
